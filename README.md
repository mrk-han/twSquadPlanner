# twSquadPlanner

**tl;dr** Chrome extension that scrapes swgoh.gg character collection (6k+ power only) and allows you to arrange them in squads for the Guild Event Territory Wars.

### Pre-requisites

* Chrome
* SWGoH.gg profile w/ characters 6k+ power

### How do I use it?

1. Install the extension:
   1. Clone the repository or download the zip archive and extract it to a folder
   2. Go to `chrome://extensions/` and load the repository folder as an "unpacked extension"
2. Navigate to your swgoh.gg collection (e.g. https://swgoh.gg/u/toleressea/collection/)
3. Click the extension (T) icon and "Get Toons" (you must be on the right page to get toons successfully)
4. Drag'n'drop toons into squads and "Save" to have the extension remember your squads setup
